For me, you are unattractive to look at.
For me, you are simply not an attractive sight to behold.
I apologize, but you don't catch my attention with your looks.
I regret to inform you that your looks are not my cup of tea.
I apologize, but your looks are not captivating to me.
I'm sorry, but I don't find you all that attractive to look at.
For me, your appearance is not visually appealing.
I'm sorry, but I don't find you physically attractive.
For me, you are hard to attracts me.
Your looks don't do it for me, I'm sorry to say.
