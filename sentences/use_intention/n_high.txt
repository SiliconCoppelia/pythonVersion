I know it's rude but I have no use for you.
So, let's definitely not see each other again, all right? Sorry!
I know it's rude, but I don't need you.
So, we must never see each other again, okay? Sorry!
It's rude to say that, but I don't want to see you again!
So all I can say is that I don't really need you anymore.
There's meaingless in seeing you again!
It is meaningless to see you again!
Sorry! But we don't need to meet anymore.
